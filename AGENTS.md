# Repository workflow

## Writing (all apps and documents)

- Before making any repository edit, read [docs/writing.md](docs/writing.md).
- Every document must include front matter.
- All UI text and documentation across every app must follow Apple's clarity guidance as summarized in that document. This includes labels, messages, accessibility text, examples, design documents, and worklogs.
- Review all added or changed wording against the guide before finishing. When editing an existing document or UI flow, check its surrounding wording for consistency. Use concrete descriptions and actions; remove vague reassurance and promotional filler.

## Branches and validation

- This is a single-maintainer repository. Work directly on the default branch (`master`).
- Do not create feature branches or pull requests unless the user explicitly asks for one.
- Use Conventional Commits format for commit messages (for example, `feat: add export support` or `fix(audio): handle device loss`).
- Before committing, inspect the complete diff and run the relevant checks.
- For standalone or temporary Python scripts, use `uv run --no-project` and add required third-party packages with `--with` (for example, `uv run --no-project --with httpx script.py`). Use the repository's normal project environment for project-owned Python code.

## Current APIs and deprecations (all apps)

- Prefer the latest stable, supported APIs and platform features across all apps in this repository, while respecting their declared minimum platform versions.
- Treat deprecation warnings as actionable maintenance work. When encountered during development or validation, investigate and migrate affected code to the supported replacement; do not silently ignore or suppress the warnings.
- Check current official documentation for replacement APIs and validate the resulting behavior. Do not introduce deprecated APIs into new code.
- If migration is blocked by a dependency or a supported older platform, document the warning, reason, compatibility fallback, and concrete follow-up in the worklog. Report remaining warnings explicitly; do not describe a build as warning-free when it is not.

## Worklogs

When a task changes repository code, create or update a concise worklog under
`docs/worklogs/` named `YYYY-MM-DD-short-name.md`. Use a YAML metadata header
and record progress, key decisions, results, and blockers as the task evolves,
without repeating information. Do not create a worklog for a task that makes no
repository code changes unless the user explicitly requests one.

- **Problem:** what was wrong or missing.
- **Implemented solution:** what changed and where.
- **Reasoning:** why this approach was chosen, including important tradeoffs or
  rejected alternatives.
- **Technical debt:** state whether the sub-task introduced or retained any
  shortcut, deferred compromise, compatibility bridge, temporary duplication,
  or database/schema debt. For each applicable item, record why it was
  accepted, its operational or maintenance consequence, and the concrete
  future remediation. Write `None` when the assessment found no added or
  retained technical debt.
- **Notes:** optional related context worth preserving, such as compatibility,
  migration, validation, release, or remaining-blocker details.
