# client-macos-rust

The native macOS Rust client in the [Gday Meetings client/server/worker architecture](../../docs/architecture.md). Run commands below from the repository root.

**gday-meetings** is a local-first meeting recorder and transcription tool. It captures microphone and system audio as separate tracks, transcribes and summarizes meetings, and exposes everything via a REST API with a built-in web UI.

## Features

- **Zero setup** — no virtual audio devices or kernel extensions needed, just install and run
- **Multi-track recording** — capture microphone and system audio simultaneously as separate tracks
- **Concurrent sessions** — run multiple recording sessions in parallel, each with its own set of audio tracks
- **Multi-format** — WAV (lossless), MP3 (CBR), and Opus (VBR) output
- **Recordings management** — create, name, start/stop, delete sessions with persistent metadata
- **Web UI** — built-in single-page client with real-time updates via WebSocket
- **REST API** — full resource-based API for session and recording management
- **Low resource usage** — built with Rust; ~2% CPU for WAV, ~4% for Opus, ~6% for MP3

## Installation

Requires macOS 14.2+, the [stable Rust toolchain](https://rustup.rs), Xcode Command Line Tools (Git, Make, Clang and SDK), and CMake for the bundled Opus encoder. See [complete setup and troubleshooting](../../docs/macos-setup.md). From the repository root:

```bash
make doctor
make install
```

This builds an ad-hoc signed `Gday Meetings.app` and opens a Finder folder with an Applications shortcut. Drag the app onto Applications, then double-click the installed app. It starts the local server and opens the browser UI. The Rust app uses bundle identifier `com.gdaymeetings.macos.rust` and stores data in `~/.local/share/com.gdaymeetings.macos.rust`. On first launch it atomically moves the historical `~/.local/share/org.rankun.meeting-notes` directory only when the new destination is absent; it never merges two existing libraries. Quit older client versions before migration. Changing the bundle identity requires granting microphone and system-audio permissions again. The Swift app has its own incompatible storage schema under `~/.local/share/com.gdaymeetings.macos`; do not point either client directly at the other library. The installer folder is a separate copy, so dragging it away does not remove the development build. Close a running installed app before replacing it in Finder.

This workflow uses built-in `ditto`, `codesign` and Finder; it does not need a DMG builder or copy over `/Applications` automatically. For command-line-only installation, `cargo install --git https://github.com/rankun203/meeting-notes gday-meetings-client` remains available.

Both macOS clients share the installer layout and artwork in `apps/packaging/macos/`. The installer places the app on the left and Applications on the right, uses Snap to Grid and Retina drag instructions, and selects the app to populate Finder's preview pane when enabled. Its taller window leaves room for version information. To regenerate the bundled background artwork, run `uv run --no-project --with pillow apps/packaging/macos/render-installer-background.py` from the repository root; Pillow is only needed when regenerating the artwork.

## Usage

```bash
# Build and run the local app without installing it
make start
make start CLIENT_ARGS="--port 8080"

# CLI use after cargo install (terminal permissions apply)
gday-meetings-client serve --web-ui

# Custom port and data directory
gday-meetings-client serve --port 8080 --data-dir ~/my-recordings --web-ui
```

By default, the OS selects an available port (`--port 0`). Finder launches and
`make start` open the browser at the assigned URL automatically. For CLI launches,
use the URL printed in the logs or add `--open`. Specify `--port 8080` (or another
fixed port) when an integration needs a stable address; an occupied explicit port
causes startup to fail.

For durable transcription results and a shared recordings admin, connect
[Gday Meetings Server](../server). See the
[setup and migration guide](../../docs/gday-meetings.md).

### macOS recording permissions

When running from this repository, use the macOS launcher:

```bash
make start
# Optional server arguments:
make start CLIENT_ARGS="--port 8080 --data-dir ~/my-recordings"
```

This builds and signs `apps/client-macos-rust/target/macos/Gday Meetings.app`, then launches it
through macOS LaunchServices. Allow **Gday Meetings** to use your microphone and
record system audio when you start a recording. The launcher stays in the
foreground and streams daemon logs to your terminal (also saved in
`~/Library/Logs/Gday Meetings/client.YYYY-MM-DD.log`). Press **Ctrl+C** to stop the daemon and finalize
active recordings; press it again to force quit if shutdown is stuck. Stop any
existing daemon before launching the app on the same port.

The client itself saves logs for Finder, CLI and development launches. Open the
folder with `open "$HOME/Library/Logs/Gday Meetings"`, or Finder's **Go → Go to
Folder**. Logs rotate daily (UTC dates), retain up to 14 files, and contain plain
text without terminal color codes. This limits file count, not the size of an
individual day's log. `RUST_LOG` controls verbosity; `GDAY_MEETINGS_LOG_DIR`
overrides the folder for testing. New log directories are private to your user.
If the folder cannot be opened, the client warns on stderr and continues.
Rust panic diagnostics are logged; abrupt OS termination or native crashes are
not guaranteed to produce a final log entry.

To stop an instance from another terminal (including one started by the older
development launcher), run `make stop`. This requests a graceful
shutdown and finalizes active recordings without rebuilding the app.

The bundle includes `NSAudioCaptureUsageDescription` and
`NSMicrophoneUsageDescription`. These purpose strings let macOS present permission
requests ([Apple's Core Audio tap documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coreaudio/capturing-system-audio-with-core-audio-taps)).
Running `cargo run` or executing the binary directly can instead attribute those
requests to your terminal. If the terminal lacks the system-audio purpose string,
macOS may reject the request without showing a dialog, while Core Audio still
starts and returns silent buffers. The launcher avoids that terminal dependency;
executing the binary inside the `.app` directly does not.

If access was denied, enable **Gday Meetings** in **System Settings → Privacy &
Security → Microphone / Screen & System Audio Recording**, then restart the daemon
and recording. Local ad-hoc builds may need permission again after rebuilding.
Use `make build` to prepare the bundle without launching
it or interrupting an existing CLI recording.

Live capture warnings measure incoming audio, independently of compressed file
size. After a 10-second startup grace period, missing buffers or initial system
silence generate a warning in both the UI and daemon logs. After sound has been
received, system silence is reported after 30 seconds. Silence alone cannot prove
permission was denied: nothing playing or an output-routing issue can also cause it.

## Architecture

This package captures and retains local audio, embeds the browser UI, and exposes a loopback API. It authenticates to [the server](../server) for managed uploads and durable jobs. The [worker](../worker-audio-extraction) runs separately; its Python/ML dependencies are not installed with this client. See [system architecture](../../docs/architecture.md).

## Development

```bash
# Run the app with debug logging
RUST_BACKTRACE=1 RUST_LOG=gday_meetings_client=debug make start
make test-client

# Or work directly inside this independent Cargo package
cd apps/client-macos-rust
cargo test --locked
bash scripts/build-macos.sh
bash scripts/run-macos.sh --port 8080
```

Finder launches without arguments default to `serve --web-ui --open`. The app adds a waveform icon to the macOS menu bar, with **Open Gday Meetings**, **Status**, **Show Logs**, and **Quit Gday Meetings**. Open uses the currently assigned port. Status shows Starting, Ready, Recording (with a count and a dot beside the icon), or Stopping. Quit finalizes active recordings and shuts down the local server before removing the icon.

The app uses the browser UI and has no Dock icon or separate window; closing the browser does not stop it. Both Finder and `make start` run the menu bar shell. An ordinary CLI binary stays terminal-only and requires a subcommand; Ctrl+C and `make stop` retain their graceful shutdown behavior.
