# Build and install the macOS client

## Requirements

- **macOS 14.2 or newer**, with a logged-in desktop session for Finder installation and launching the app. The build targets the current Rust host architecture; it does not create a universal binary. Apple Silicon is the currently validated development platform.
- **Xcode Command Line Tools**: Git, Make, Clang and a macOS SDK (14.2 or newer). Full Xcode is optional. Install with `xcode-select --install`, then finish the installer before continuing. See [Apple's installation instructions](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/installing-the-command-line-tools).
- **Stable Rust and Cargo**, installed using [rustup](https://rustup.rs). Reopen Terminal after installation, or run `source "$HOME/.cargo/env"`. For an older toolchain, run `rustup update stable`.
- **CMake** for the bundled Opus audio encoder. If using Homebrew, run `brew install cmake`; otherwise install CMake and put its command-line tools on PATH. Homebrew itself is optional. The build script supplies the compatibility policy floor needed by the bundled Opus project on CMake 4.
- Internet access for the first Cargo dependency download, free disk space for Rust build artifacts, and a writable checkout. Initial compilation can take several minutes and build artifacts can occupy several GB.

The client does not require Node.js, pnpm, Python, Docker, a GPU, or the server/worker dependencies. Cargo builds the native audio encoders. Git, Rust, Make and CMake are build-time tools; users do not need them to run the finished app. Media-file import additionally uses `ffmpeg` on the app's PATH. Transcription and AI features require their separately configured services; recording itself runs locally.

## Clone, check, install

After installing the prerequisites:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/rankun203/meeting-notes.git
cd meeting-notes
make doctor
make install
```

`make install` checks prerequisites, compiles the release binary, creates the app bundle, signs it locally, verifies the signature, stages a separate installer copy, and opens a dedicated Finder window in icon view. Drag **Gday Meetings.app** onto **Applications**, then open the installed app. Your default Finder view is unchanged. macOS may request permission for the terminal to control Finder; if declined, the installer opens normally and prints a reminder to press **Command-1** for icon view. Quit an existing copy before replacing it. Finder may request permission to write to Applications; do not run `sudo make`.

Signing is automatic and **ad-hoc**: no Apple Developer account, paid membership, certificate, or provisioning profile is required. This is a local build, not a notarized distribution. Neither these scripts nor the app disable Gatekeeper.

For development, `make start` builds and launches without installing; `make build` only builds. `make doctor` only checks tools and prints versions—it does not install software or change system settings. Build/start/install run the same preflight automatically. If Make itself is missing, install the Command Line Tools first; a Make target cannot diagnose a missing Make executable.

## First launch

The app lives in the menu bar and opens its browser UI on an automatically selected local port. Allow the requested microphone and screen/system-audio recording permissions in **System Settings → Privacy & Security**. Restart the app if macOS requests it. Closing the browser does not quit the client; use **Quit Gday Meetings** in its waveform menu.

Runtime logs are in `~/Library/Logs/Gday Meetings/` (or `GDAY_MEETINGS_LOG_DIR`). **Show Logs** opens the current file in Console.app. Build errors appear in the terminal, not in the runtime log.

## When something fails

Preflight reports missing tools with installation guidance before compiling. Build, signing, verification, installer-copy and Finder failures keep the original command output and exit status, then explain the failed step. Other script failures report the script and line.

| Failure | Action |
| --- | --- |
| Missing Git/Make/Clang or SDK | Finish `xcode-select --install`; check `xcode-select -p` if you already have Xcode. Update Command Line Tools if the SDK is too old. |
| Missing Cargo/Rust | Install Rust through rustup and reopen Terminal. |
| Dependency requires a newer Rust | `rustup update stable`; confirm `rustc --version` in this checkout. |
| Missing CMake | Install CMake and ensure `cmake --version` works. |
| Cargo download failure | Check network/proxy access to crates.io; retry the same command. |
| Packaging/copy failure | Check free disk space and ownership/write access to the checkout. |
| Signing/verification failure | Read codesign's diagnostic, rebuild, and do not install a bundle that fails verification. No certificate should be necessary. |
| Finder cannot open | Use a logged-in desktop session; the message gives the installer directory to open manually. |
| App exits during launch | Read the terminal output and daily runtime log. Remove a fixed `--port` or use `--port 0` for conflicts. |
| Existing app is running | Stop recordings and quit that app before rebuilding/replacing its bundle. |

For a bug report, include `make doctor` output and the failing step's terminal output. Review logs for private meeting information or credentials before sharing them.
